# 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Jesse

**IT Support Specialist | Aspiring Cloud & Cybersecurity Professional | ITIL-Aligned AWS Projects**

I have 7+ years of hands-on IT support experience across Windows, networking, POS systems and SQL, and I’m now focused on cloud, DevOps and security – especially **ITIL-aligned architectures on AWS** and practical cybersecurity labs.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On Right Now

- **Cloud & AWS:** Designing small but realistic 3-tier architectures (VPC, ALB, EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, CloudWatch).
- **IT Support & Operations:** Strong L1–L2 troubleshooting, ticketing, documentation, and customer communication.
- **Cybersecurity Practice:** Daily labs on TryHackMe to build skills in hardening, privilege escalation, and log analysis.
- **Career Goal:** Move into a role that combines **IT support + cloud + security** (Cloud Support / IT Support / Sec-inclined roles).

---

## 🎓 Certifications & Training

- ✅ **ITIL 4 Foundation Certified**
- ✅ **Google IT Support Professional Certificate**
- ✅ **Cisco Security Operations Centre (SOC)  (2024)**
- ✅ **Linux Unhatched – Cisco (2024)**
- 📚 **CompTIA Security+** – course and Trainig completed on Udemy 


> I combine formal ITIL & support experience with continuous learning in cloud and cybersecurity.

## 🏗️ Flagship Project – ITIL × AWS 3-Tier SmartSolve Portal

**Repo:** [`itil-aws-sla-3tier-smartsolve-portal`](https://github.com/jsamuelkamau-dot/itil-aws-sla-3tier-smartsolve-portal)

A **3-tier IT support portal** designed to show how ITIL practices map onto real AWS architecture and SLAs.

**Architecture highlights:**

- **Network & Security**
  - Dedicated **VPC** with public subnets for ALB/EC2 and private subnets for the database.
  - **Security groups** enforcing least privilege between web, app and data tiers.
  - Internet access only via **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.

- **Compute & Data**
  - Highly-available **EC2 web/app tier** across multiple AZs.
  - **RDS** database in private subnets.
  - Support for components like **ECS / EKS / Lambda / S3 / IAM / CloudWatch** as the project grows.

- **ITIL & SLA Mapping**
  - Designed to demonstrate **Incident Management, Change Management and Service Level Management**.
  - Use of **CloudWatch metrics, logs and alarms** to simulate SLA monitoring (availability, response times, error rates).
  - Documentation and LinkedIn posts describing **Day-by-Day build logs** (VPC → subnets → routing → ALB → EC2 → monitoring).

This project is my main portfolio piece to show how I think about **operations, reliability and security**, not just spinning up random AWS services.

## 🛡️ TryHackMe – Cybersecurity Practice

I use **TryHackMe** to sharpen troubleshooting and security skills: endpoint hardening, privilege escalation, basic red-team techniques, and log analysis.

  - **Cybersecurity Job Simulations:**  Hands-on labs and simulations (ANZ, Telstra, Cisco SOC) to bridge IT support with security operations.
  

## 🛰 Cisco Packet Tracer Labs (Advanced Diploma Telecommunications Networks- IN PROGRESS)

As part of my Advanced Diploma in Telecommunications Network Engineering, I completed several hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer configurations that strengthened my networking fundamentals:

- **Site-to-Site VPN Between HQ and Branch**  
  Configured secure communication between two remote sites using VPN tunnels, crypto maps, routing, and verification commands.

- **Router & Interface Module Selection**  
  Identified and installed correct modules (Ethernet, Serial, WIC) on Cisco ISR routers to meet client connectivity requirements.

- **Enterprise Network Design Basics**  
  Built small enterprise topologies with routers, switches, wireless access points, and PCs, focusing on addressing, routing, and connectivity testing.

- **Campus LAN & VLAN Concepts**  
  Practised VLAN segmentation, trunking, and inter-switch connectivity to understand traffic separation and performance.

- **Wireless Integration**  
  Connected wireless access points through ISR routers and enabled end-to-end connectivity between wired and wireless segments.

These labs gave me practical experience in selecting hardware, configuring interfaces, building secure networks, and troubleshooting real-world scenarios.



## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

I’m currently open to roles such as:

- **L1–L2 Helpdesk / IT Support Technician**
- **Cloud Support Roles**
- **IT Support with a Security / SOC angle**

If your team needs someone who can **own tickets, communicate clearly with users, and grow into cloud & security responsibilities**, I would be happy to connect.
