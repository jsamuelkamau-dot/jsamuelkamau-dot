# 👋 Hi, I’m Samuel Jesse

**IT Support Specialist | Aspiring Cloud & Cybersecurity Professional | ITIL-Aligned AWS Projects**

I have 7+ years of hands-on IT support experience across Windows, networking, POS systems and SQL, and I’m now focused on cloud, DevOps and security – especially **ITIL-aligned architectures on AWS** and practical cybersecurity labs.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On Right Now

- **Cloud & AWS:** Designing small but realistic 3-tier architectures (VPC, ALB, EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, CloudWatch).
- **IT Support & Operations:** Strong L1–L2 troubleshooting, ticketing, documentation, and customer communication.
- **Cybersecurity Practice:** Daily labs on TryHackMe to build skills in hardening, privilege escalation, and log analysis.
- **Career Goal:** Move into a role that combines **IT support + cloud + security** (Cloud Support / IT Support / Sec-inclined roles).

---

## 🎓 Certifications & Training

- ✅ **ITIL 4 Foundation Certified**
- ✅ **Google IT Support Professional Certificate**
- ✅ **Cisco Security Operations Centre (SOC) – Job Simulation / Training**
- ✅ **Linux Unhatched – Cisco (2024)**
- 📚 **CompTIA Security+** – course completed on Udemy (preparing for certification exam)
- 🎯 **Cybersecurity Job Simulations:** ANZ Australia & Telstra
- 🧪 **Cisco Packet Tracer Enterprise Network Design Lab**

> I combine formal ITIL & support experience with continuous learning in cloud and cybersecurity.

## 🏗️ Flagship Project – ITIL × AWS 3-Tier SmartSolve Portal

**Repo:** [`itil-aws-sla-3tier-smartsolve-portal`](https://github.com/jsamuelkamau-dot/itil-aws-sla-3tier-smartsolve-portal)

A **3-tier IT support portal** designed to show how ITIL practices map onto real AWS architecture and SLAs.

**Architecture highlights:**

- **Network & Security**
  - Dedicated **VPC** with public subnets for ALB/EC2 and private subnets for the database.
  - **Security groups** enforcing least privilege between web, app and data tiers.
  - Internet access only via **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.

- **Compute & Data**
  - Highly-available **EC2 web/app tier** across multiple AZs.
  - **RDS** database in private subnets.
  - Support for components like **ECS / EKS / Lambda / S3 / IAM / CloudWatch** as the project grows.

- **ITIL & SLA Mapping**
  - Designed to demonstrate **Incident Management, Change Management and Service Level Management**.
  - Use of **CloudWatch metrics, logs and alarms** to simulate SLA monitoring (availability, response times, error rates).
  - Documentation and LinkedIn posts describing **Day-by-Day build logs** (VPC → subnets → routing → ALB → EC2 → monitoring).

This project is my main portfolio piece to show how I think about **operations, reliability and security**, not just spinning up random AWS services.

## 🛡️ TryHackMe – Cybersecurity Practice

I use **TryHackMe** to sharpen troubleshooting and security skills: endpoint hardening, privilege escalation, basic red-team techniques, and log analysis.
